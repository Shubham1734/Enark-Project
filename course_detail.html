Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace. However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.And how can you do that?Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming) Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture.Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out Mathematics  statistics Python Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python Data Visualization Machine Learning Deep Learning Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you donâ€™t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is. ',
